This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
### Check Files Gui
This project is an example of the functionality of a .Net Core framework and MVC web application to be able to create a fully functional website that could be hosted on the azure cloud application.
